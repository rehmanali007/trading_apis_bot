* [X] ~~*IS uniswap returning conversion rate price for the swap? It doesnt seem to.*~~ [2021-01-17] 
        It is more or less hiding the price conversion cost inside the returned value. WE could take that based on the price of eth and gth at the time
        of the swap and reverse what the conversion rate was, but that would be rather cumbersome. 
        This has been fixed with the total price of all trades / total volume all trades.
